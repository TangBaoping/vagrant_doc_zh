<h1>Command-Line Interface</h1>

<p>Almost all interaction with Vagrant is done through the command-line
interface.</p>

<p>The interface is available using the <code>vagrant</code> command, and comes installed
with Vagrant automatically. The <code>vagrant</code> command in turn has many subcommands,
such as <code>vagrant up</code>, <code>vagrant destroy</code>, etc.</p>

<p>If you run <code>vagrant</code> by itself, help will be displayed showing all available
subcommands. In addition to this, you can run any Vagrant command with the
<code>-h</code> flag to output help about that specific command. For example, try
running <code>vagrant init -h</code>. The help will output a one sentence synopsis of
what the command does as well as a list of all the flags the command
accepts.</p>

<p>In depth documentation and use cases of various Vagrant commands is
available by reading the appropriate sub-section available in the left
navigational area of this site.</p>

<p>You may also wish to consult the
<a href="javascript:$('#contentWrap').load('other/environmental-variables.html');" >documentation</a> regarding the
environmental variables that can be used to configure and control
Vagrant in a global way.</p>
